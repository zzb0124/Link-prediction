# Link-prediction

Link prediction with methods implemented. There are also some functions used to analyaze the network and the similarities. Main work is in Evaluation_of_link_prediction_methods.ipynb and Graph_Analysis.ipynb files using networkx package in python. The graph_tool_AUC.ipynb and community_inference.ipynb file require the grqaph-tool package installed (https://graph-tool.skewed.de/). The graph_figure.ipynb also requires graph_tool package and the state.draw() and Graph.draw() method don't work in version 2.43 in Ubtune but they work in graph-tool 2.42 in Docker. There is also a pdf of my rearch report with description of the methods implemented.
